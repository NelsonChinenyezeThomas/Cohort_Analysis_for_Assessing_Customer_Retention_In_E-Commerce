# Cohort Analysis for Assessing Customer Retention in E-commerce

## Project Overview
This project performs a cohort analysis to evaluate customer retention in the e-commerce industry. By analyzing customer purchase patterns over time, this analysis aims to identify trends in customer loyalty, the retention rate across different cohorts, and overall customer behavior. This information is essential for understanding and improving long-term customer engagement strategies.

## Key Questions Answered
The analysis addresses the following questions:
1. How does the retention rate vary across different cohorts?
2. Which cohorts have the highest retention rates?
3. What are the retention trends over time?
4. How can customer retention be improved based on cohort analysis insights?

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data handling and visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: as the development environment for an interactive data analysis process.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of customer transaction data in the e-commerce sector, including information on:
- **Customer ID**: unique identifier for each customer.
- **Transaction Date**: date of each transaction.
- **Other variables** (as applicable): may include purchase amounts, product categories, or customer segments.

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and prepare for cohort analysis.
2. **Cohort Definition**: Grouping customers into cohorts based on their initial purchase date to analyze retention over time.
3. **Retention Calculation**: Calculating monthly retention rates for each cohort to understand how many customers return to make additional purchases.
4. **Visualization**: Creating heatmaps and line graphs to visualize retention patterns across cohorts and timeframes.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The cohort analysis reveals critical trends in customer retention, such as:
- Certain cohorts exhibit higher retention rates, potentially due to promotional campaigns or seasonal influences.
- Retention declines over time, suggesting a need for strategies to re-engage customers after their initial purchase.
  
**Recommendations**:
- Implement targeted re-engagement campaigns for customers in cohorts with declining retention.
- Explore loyalty programs or personalized offers for high-retention cohorts to further boost their loyalty.
- Regularly perform cohort analysis to monitor customer retention trends and adjust strategies as needed.
